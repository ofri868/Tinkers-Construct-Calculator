## Download

### Option 1: Pre-built App

1. Download the `.zip` file from the [latest release](https://github.com/ofri868/Tinkers-Construct-Calculator/releases)
2. Extract the `.zip` file
3. Inside the extracted folder, run `TinkersConstructCalculator.exe`

> ⚠️ Ensure all files remain in the same folder — the `.exe` requires the `runtime/` and `app/` directories.
